# Stock Trader App

I created a dynamic JavaScript stock trading app using vue.js framework. The site contains multiple pages and can dynamically store and handle data across all pages. To run the application follow the steps below:

### Version requirement
Node versions required: `v14.17.3`
To intall node version `v14.17.3`, run the following command:
```
npm install -g n
```
`n` is a package for node version management
```
n 14.17.3
```
This will download node `v14.17.3`

### Clone repository using git
```
git clone git@github.com:ammar20112001/vue.js-stock-trader-app.git
```

### Install dependencies and run application using npm
Navigate to the cloned repository directory, and run this command to install all dependencies required:
```
npm install
```
Finally, run this command to run the application. This will create a localhost. Paste the address from terminal to the browser.
```
npm run serve
```
